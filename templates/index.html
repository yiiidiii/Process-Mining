<h3 style="padding-left: 50px"> The Alpha Miner </h3>
<p class="description">
    The α-algorithm or α-miner is an algorithm used in process mining, aimed at reconstructing causality from a set of sequences of events.
    It was first put forward by van der Aalst, Weijters and Măruşter. The goal of Alpha miner is to convert the event log into a workflow-net based on the relations
    between various activities in the event log. An event log is a multi-set of traces, and a trace is a sequence of activity names.
<br>
    Alpha miner was the first process discovery algorithm ever proposed, and it gives a good overview of the aim of process discovery and how various activities
    within the process are executed. Alpha miner was also the basis for the development of many other process mining techniques such as heuristic miner, genetic
    mining was developed based on the idea alpha miner is built on.

    <h2 id="upload">Petri Net from uploaded XES file</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 20px;">
        Here, you can upload a XES file to generate the petri net and its statistics.
        Note that an incorrect XES file will end up in an error.
    </p>

    <form method="POST" enctype="multipart/form-data">

    <p style="font-size: 18px; padding: 20px;">
        By clicking on any of the buttons, the respective petri net is generated with the alpha miner and you are redirected to
        another page where the graph and statistics regarding the xes file is shown. The XES files are taken from
        <a href="https://lehre.bpm.in.tum.de/~pm-prak/datasets/" id="link_page">here</a>.

    <h3>Initial Testing</h3>
    <!-- harcoded the link to work on server, but then does not work on localserver anymore -->
